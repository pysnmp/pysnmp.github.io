// site and that is all -- but the site is where a contributor's first pull
// request to the organization often lands, and the habit picked up fixing a
// typo here carries over to pysnmp, where the message is the input to the
// release rather than decoration.
//
// One file, two places. The commit-msg hook in .pre-commit-config.yaml checks a
// message as it is written; .github/workflows/commit-conventions.yml checks
// every commit in a pull request. Both read this config, so a message that
// passes locally passes in CI.
